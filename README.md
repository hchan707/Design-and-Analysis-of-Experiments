# 🧪 Design and Analysis of Experiments Portfolio

This repository contains a series of statistical projects using experimental design and regression methods. Each study was completed as part of UCSB’s PSTAT 122 course, focusing on real-world questions related to health, behavior, and environmental impact.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. 💓 **2x3 Factorial Design: Caffeine and Noise Effects on Pulse Rate**
**Type:** Full Factorial Design  
**Factors:** 3 levels of caffeine × 2 levels of noise (6 total combinations)  
**Design:** Self-experiment with 54 trials  
**Key Skills:** ANOVA, interaction modeling, assumption checks, linear modeling  
**Findings:** Green Tea + Quiet = lowest pulse rate; Red Bull + Loud = highest

### 2. ✈️ **Paper Airplane Flight Distance (RCBD)**
**Type:** Randomized Complete Block Design  
**Goal:** Measure differences in airplane performance while controlling for block effects (e.g., thrower, environment)  
**Analysis:** ANOVA with blocking  
**Takeaway:** Certain designs consistently outperform others when adjusting for block variability

### 3. 🫁 **Breath-Holding Time Study (GRBD + Factorial)**
**Type:** Generalized Randomized Block Design + Factorial Design  
**Factors:** Breathing technique × Gender  
**Analysis:** Factorial model with block structure  
**Result:** Interaction found—preparation method affects results differently across genders
